#Bamazon

### Description
***

A shopping app that uses Node.JS and MySQL to allow users to purchase items as a customer, view and update product inventory as a manager, and track total sales by department as an executive.

##### Bamazon Customer Portal
***


In the Customer Portal users will be asked if they would like to buy an item and then shown a list of the product inventory. They will then have the option to select an item and choose the number of items they would like to purchase. If the item and stock quantity is available the transaction will go through and the quantity will be changed in the MySQL database, if not, they will be alerted that they cannot make the purchase.
